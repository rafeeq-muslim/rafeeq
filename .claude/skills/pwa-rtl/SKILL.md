# pwa-rtl

Makes the app correct — not just flipped — in right-to-left locales. Covers §8
(**P-801..P-808**).

**Audit first:**

```bash
node "<pwa-audit-skill-dir>/scripts/run-audit.mjs" "<path-to-app>"
```

Resolve `<pwa-audit-skill-dir>` from the selected `pwa-audit/SKILL.md`, not from the target
repository.

Static detection catches physical CSS properties (P-801) and hardcoded strings well;
mirroring and bidi correctness are `visual` — they need a rendered RTL pass. `pwa-verify`
exercises RTL only when the repository declares RTL routes or scenarios; otherwise P-1207
remains `UNVERIFIED`.

## What it fixes

- **P-801** — **logical properties, not physical.** `margin-inline-start`,
  `padding-inline-end`, `inset-inline-start`, `text-align: start`. In Tailwind: `ms-*`/`me-*`/`ps-*`/`pe-*`,
  never `ml-*`/`mr-*`. Physical-direction CSS stays LTR-shaped inside an Arabic UI. This is
  the single highest-yield RTL fix and is statically enforced by the scanner.
- **P-803** — set `dir` and `lang` on `<html>` (and any locale-scoped subtree) to match the
  active locale. Missing them breaks the bidi algorithm and screen-reader pronunciation —
  do this **first**, it's the precondition for everything else rendering correctly.
- **P-804** — wrap embedded LTR runs (phone numbers, `+970`, URLs, latin brand names) in
  `<bdi>` / `unicode-bidi: isolate` so they don't reorder wrongly inside Arabic text.
- **P-802** — mirror direction-bearing glyphs (back chevrons, "next" arrows). **Never**
  mirror logos, media/play controls, or clocks.
- **P-805** — enforce Arabic-capable faces — **Tajawal / Cairo / IBM Plex Sans Arabic**
  (the standing modern-fonts rule) with an explicit Arabic subset. A system fallback gives
  inconsistent weights, broken ligatures, and tofu.
- **P-806** — drive slide/transition direction from the active `dir`, not a hardcoded LTR
  assumption (drawers must enter from the correct edge; "next" must not run backwards).
- **P-807** — route all user-facing text through the i18n layer (`t()` calls); no raw
  literal strings in components, or it never localises.
- **P-808** — format numerals/dates/currency with `Intl.NumberFormat` /
  `Intl.DateTimeFormat` (or the app's i18n layer) consistently — not a mix of Arabic-Indic
  and Latin digits within one screen.

## Order of operations

1. **P-803** — set `dir`/`lang`. Nothing below renders correctly until the document knows its direction.
2. **P-801** — convert physical → logical properties (the bulk of the work; the scanner lists the sites).
3. **P-807 / P-808** — route strings and number/date formatting through i18n.
4. **P-804 / P-802 / P-805 / P-806** — bidi isolation, icon mirroring, fonts, directional motion.

## Standalone vs superpowers

Works standalone. When `superpowers` is available (detect **by capability** — is
`test-driven-development` invocable now? — never by path-sniffing):

- **`test-driven-development`** — write the probe (set `dir=rtl`, assert no physical
  `margin-left`/`right` leaks into layout, assert embedded LTR runs stay intact), watch it
  fail, fix, watch it pass.
- **`verification-before-completion`** / `pwa-verify` — the done-gate. Switch the app to
  RTL / an Arabic locale and re-check layout before claiming done (P-1207); mirroring and
  bidi correctness are visual and won't show in a static pass.

Absent superpowers: set `dir="rtl"` (and an Arabic locale), then walk the app — check
alignment, drawer entry edge, back-arrow direction, phone-number/URL rendering inside Arabic
paragraphs, and that no text renders as tofu.
